## Introduction

Creating star patterns is a common exercise in programming. It allows you to practice loops, conditionals, and other fundamental concepts. This repository provides code snippets in various programming languages to generate star patterns. You can learn how to create different shapes and designs by modifying the code.

## Features

- Supports multiple programming languages (Python, Java, C++, etc.)
- Easy-to-understand code snippets
- Examples of various star patterns
- Interactive console output for user engagement

## Installation

To get started, you need to clone this repository. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bhanu070820/star-pattern.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd star-pattern
```

## Usage

To generate star patterns, you can execute the main file in your preferred programming language. Each language has its own folder with the necessary code. For example, if you want to run the Python version, navigate to the Python folder and execute:

```bash
python star_pattern.py
```

You can modify the code to create different patterns by changing the loop conditions and output format.

## Examples

Here are some examples of star patterns you can create:

### Right-Angled Triangle

```
*
**
***
****
```

### Pyramid

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
```

### Diamond

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
 *****
  ***
   *
```

Feel free to explore the code and create your own unique patterns!
